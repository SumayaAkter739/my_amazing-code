## üéì Ph.D. Research  
**Department of Molecular, Cellular, and Biochemical Science**  
**University of New Hampshire, Durham, NH, U.S.A.**  
**Advisor:** Dr. Xuanmao Chen  
**Duration:** August 2023 ‚Äì Present  

My Ph.D. research investigates how **Reelin signaling** regulates neuronal polarity, cilia orientation, and laminar organization during cortical development.  
The project, titled *‚ÄúReelin Controls Cilia Directionality and Centriole Positioning in Laminated Cortical Regions,‚Äù* uses high-resolution confocal imaging, immunostaining, and quantitative morphometric analysis to uncover how ciliary signaling contributes to neuronal positioning and cortical refinement in both wild-type and *Reeler* mice.
