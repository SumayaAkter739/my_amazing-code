My recent work shows that pyramidal neuron primary cilia often sit near the base of apical dendrites and orient opposite the axon initial segment (AIS), reflecting directional alignment along the apical‚Äìbasal axis. In Reelin-deficient (reeler) mice, this polarity is disrupted, with disoriented and elongated cilia in principal neurons across the neocortex and hippocampus‚Äîimplicating Reelin in controlling ciliary orientation and length during postnatal neurodevelopment. Using high-resolution confocal imaging, immunostaining, and quantitative morphometrics, I investigate how ciliary dynamics influence neuronal positioning, cortical patterning, and disorders such as autism, schizophrenia, and epilepsy."
