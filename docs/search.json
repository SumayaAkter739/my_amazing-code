    "text": "About Me\nMy research focuses on how primary cilia signaling and the Reelin pathway coordinate neuronal migration, polarity, and laminar organization during cortical development. My recent discovery revealed that the primary cilia of pyramidal neurons are positioned near the base of apical dendrites and oriented opposite to the axon initial segment (AIS), reflecting their directional alignment along the apical-basal axis. In Reelin-deficient (reeler) mice, this polarity is disrupted, leading to disoriented and elongated cilia in principal neurons across the neocortex and hippocampusâ€”uncovering a critical role for Reelin in controlling ciliary orientation and length during postnatal neurodevelopment. Through high-resolution confocal imaging, immunostaining, and quantitative morphometric analysis, my work aims to define how ciliary dynamics influence neuronal positioning, cortical patterning, and neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism, schizophrenia, and epilepsy."

    "text": "Graduate Teaching Assistant\nCourse: Biology (BIOL 411)\nLevel: Undergraduate (72 students)\nDuration: August 2023 - May 2024\nI served as a teaching assistant for a foundational biology lab course for first-year undergraduates. I supported students in developing essential skills in experimental design, scientific writing, and presentations, while encouraging critical thinking, hypothesis generation, and teamwork. I guided students through hands-on experiments and research practices, contributing to their overall growth in the biological sciences. My responsibilities included assisting with molecular biology experiments such as restriction enzyme digestion and photosynthesis analysis, handling model organisms including Tetrahymena and C. elegans, and supporting students in sequence analysis and data interpretation.\n\n\n\nGraduate Teaching Assistant\nCourse: Human Physiology and Anatomy I (BMS 507)\nLevel: Undergraduate (72 students)\nDuration: August 2024 - December 2024; August 2025 - December 2025\nI served as an instructor for Human Physiology and Anatomy, teaching both lecture and laboratory sessions. I guided students in exploring human anatomy and physiology through the use of human skeletons, anatomical models, and brain and eye dissections. I managed lab operations, graded assignments, and assisted faculty in exam preparation and proctoring. I helped students identify microscopic and macroscopic structures such as bones, muscles, organs, and neural systems while emphasizing the connection between structure, function, and disease.\n\n\n\nGraduate Teaching Assistant\nCourse: Human Physiology and Anatomy II (BMS 508)\nLevel: Undergraduate (500 students)\nDuration: January 2025 - May 2025\nAs a teaching assistant for Human Physiology and Anatomy II, I supported large undergraduate classes by supervising laboratory sections and assisting students in understanding physiological mechanisms through practical exercises. I facilitated active learning by encouraging discussion, clarifying lecture materials, and providing individualized academic support. My role involved assisting with exam organization, maintaining lab equipment, and ensuring a positive and productive learning environment."
