    "text": "Hello! My name is Sumaya Akter, and I am a PhD student in Neuroscience at the University of New Hampshire.\nMy research focuses on how primary cilia signaling and the Reelin signaling pathway regulate neuronal migration and laminar organization in the cerebral cortex, with the long-term goal of linking these basic mechanisms to cognitive disorders.\nI’m passionate about postnatal brain development, ciliary signaling, and cortical organization, integrating molecular biology and imaging techniques to explore brain structure and function.\nBeyond the lab, I value scientific communication, data-driven neuroscience, and collaborative, open science."
