I study how primary cilia and the Reelin signaling pathway** regulate neuronal migration and laminar organization in the cerebral cortex, with the long-term goal of connecting basic mechanisms to neurodevelopmental and cognitive disorders.\nMy work integrates confocal imaging, quantitative analysis, and rigorous statistics to map ciliary orientation, length, and apical localization across cortical regions.\n\n📍 Durham, New Hampshire\n\n✉️ sumaya.akter@unh.edu\n\n📄 Download my CV\n\n\nI’m passionate about scientific communication, data-driven neuroscience, and collaborative, open science."
