## ðŸŽ“ Ph.D. in Biochemistry (Neuroscience)

Aug 2023 â€“ Present\
Department of Molecular, Cellular, and Biochemical Science University of New Hampshire, USA Advisor: Dr. Xuanmao Chen

Project: Reelin Controls Cilia Directionality and Centriole Positioning in Laminated Cortical Regions

My doctoral research focuses on how the Reelin signaling pathway regulates neuronal polarity and ciliary orientation during cortical development. This work combines high-resolution confocal imaging, immunostaining, and quantitative analysis to explore how molecular cues shape neuronal migration and laminar organization in the mammalian brain.

## ðŸ§¬ Bachelor of Science in Biotechnology and Genetic Engineering

Jan 2018 â€“ May 2023\
Noakhali Science and Technology University (NSTU), Bangladesh

Undergraduate Project:\
In silico Characterization of a Hypothetical Protein from Streptococcus pneumoniae D39V strain reveals a Biofilm Formation Stimulator Protein.

## During my undergraduate studies, I developed a strong background in molecular biology, protein modeling, and computational bioinformatics, which provided a foundation for my current neuroscience research.
