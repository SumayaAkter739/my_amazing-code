# **Hi!**

I’m Sumaya Akter, a PhD student in Neuroscience (Biochemistry program) at the University of New Hampshire. I study how primary cilia and the Reelin signaling pathway** regulate neuronal migration and laminar organization in the cerebral cortex, with the long-term goal of connecting basic mechanisms to neurodevelopmental and cognitive disorders.

My work integrates confocal imaging, quantitative analysis, and rigorous statistics to map ciliary orientation, length, and apical localization across cortical regions.
