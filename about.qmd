Hello! My name is **Sumaya Akter**, and I am a PhD student in **Neuroscience** at the **University of New Hampshire**.  
My research focuses on **how primary cilia signaling and the Reelin signaling pathway regulate neuronal migration and laminar organization in the cerebral cortex**, with the long-term goal of linking these basic mechanisms to **cognitive disorders**.

Broadly, I am interested in **postnatal brain development, ciliary signaling, and cortical organization**, integrating molecular biology and imaging techniques to explore brain structure and function.  
Iâ€™m also passionate about **scientific communication**, data-driven neuroscience, and promoting open, collaborative science.
